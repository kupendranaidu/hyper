1.	Identify Components:
•	Web Client: Look for the code or Docker configuration related to your web client. This might include frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), a Node.js or similar server serving the frontend, or any other technologies specific to your web client.
•	Control Center: Similarly, identify the components related to your control center. This could be a separate frontend application, backend services, databases, or any other dependencies.
2.	Define Docker Compose Services:
•	Web Client Service:
•	Determine the Docker image or Dockerfile for your web client. If you don't have one, create a Dockerfile in your web client's directory.
•	Define a service for the web client in your docker-compose.yml. Here's an example assuming your web client runs on port 3000:

 
web-client:
  build: ./path/to/your/web-client  # Path to your web client's Dockerfile or code
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"  # Adjust if your web client runs on a different port
  networks:
    - router_net
  depends_on:
    - hyperswitch-server  # Assuming it depends on your backend services
  # Add other configurations as needed



Control Center Service:
•	Follow a similar process for your control center component. If it has its Docker image or Dockerfile, use that. Otherwise, create one.
•	Define a service for the control center in your docker-compose.yml. For example:



control-center:
  build: ./path/to/your/control-center  # Path to your control center's Dockerfile or code
  ports:
    - "4000:4000"  # Adjust if needed
  networks:
    - router_net
  depends_on:
    - hyperswitch-server  # Assuming it depends on your backend services
  # Add other configurations as needed


1.	Dependencies and Networking:
•	Ensure that your web client and control center services are configured to communicate with your backend services (like hyperswitch-server).
•	Use Docker Compose networks (like router_net in your current setup) to facilitate communication between services.
2.	Build and Run:
•	Once you've defined the services in your docker-compose.yml, run docker-compose build to build the new Docker images if needed.
•	Then, start all services including the new ones using docker-compose up -d.
3.	Testing and Verification:
•	Verify that your web client and control center are accessible and functioning as expected. You can do this by visiting their respective URLs in a web browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for the web client and http://localhost:4000 for the control center).
4.	Integration and Configuration:
•	Ensure that your web client and control center are configured to interact with your backend services correctly. Update any necessary environment variables, configurations, or API endpoints to make this integration seamless.
